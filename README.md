## About Citroën

Citroën is a French automobile manufacturer founded in 1919 by André Citroën. The company has been known for its innovative technology and distinctive, often revolutionary designs. Citroën became part of the PSA Peugeot Citroën group (now part of Stellantis) in 1976.

## Generations

### Early Innovation Period (1919-1945)

Citroën's initial era was marked by revolutionary engineering and manufacturing approaches:

- The **Type A** (1919) was Europe's first mass-produced car
- The **Traction Avant** (1934-1957) pioneered front-wheel drive, unibody construction, and independent suspension
- The **2CV** prototype was developed in this period (although released later)

### Post-War Revolution (1946-1975)

This period saw Citroën establish itself as a leader in technological innovation:

- The **2CV** (1948-1990) was designed as an affordable "umbrella on wheels" that became an icon of French culture
- The **DS** (1955-1975) introduced hydropneumatic self-leveling suspension, advanced aerodynamics, and futuristic styling
- The **SM** (1970-1975) combined Citroën's advanced suspension with Maserati power

### Peugeot Era (1976-2000)

After financial difficulties led to Peugeot's takeover, Citroën maintained some distinctiveness while sharing platforms:

- The **CX** (1974-1991) continued the large car tradition with aerodynamic design
- The **BX** (1982-1994) combined angular Marcello Gandini styling with practical family car attributes
- The **XM** (1989-2000) was the last of the distinctive large Citroëns with hydropneumatic suspension

### Modern Comfort Focus (2000-2016)

This period saw Citroën emphasize comfort and practicality:

- The **C3** (2002-present) became a popular supermini across multiple generations
- The **C4 Picasso/Grand Picasso** (2006-2018) reinvented the MPV segment with innovative design
- The **C6** (2005-2012) was the brand's last traditional luxury flagship

### DS Split and Dual-Brand Strategy (2016-Present)

Citroën's most recent era features a clearer brand identity after DS became a separate marque:

- The **C3 Aircross** (2017-present) and **C5 Aircross** (2018-present) reflect the brand's shift toward SUVs
- The **C4** (2020-present) blends crossover styling with hatchback practicality
- The **ë-C4** represents Citroën's move toward electrification
